## **Technology Stack**

- **Django + Django REST Framework** – RESTful API development  
- **GraphQL** – Flexible data querying  
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database  
- **Celery + Redis** – Asynchronous task queue and caching  
- **Docker** – Environment consistency across dev and deployment  
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automated testing and deployment workflows

## **Database Design**

### **Users**
Represents both guests and hosts.  
- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `name`: Full name  
- `email`: Unique email for authentication  
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password  
- `is_host`: Boolean to differentiate guests and hosts  
- **Relationships**:  
  - A user can own multiple properties  
  - A user can create multiple bookings and reviews  

### **Properties**
Represents listings available for booking.  
- `id`: Unique property identifier  
- `owner_id`: References a user (host)  
- `title`: Short description of the listing  
- `location`: Address or region  
- `price_per_night`: Cost of stay per night  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Each property belongs to one host  
  - A property can have many bookings and reviews  

### **Bookings**
Tracks reservations made by users.  
- `id`: Unique booking identifier  
- `property_id`: References the property being booked  
- `user_id`: References the guest making the booking  
- `check_in`: Check-in date  
- `check_out`: Check-out date  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Each booking links one user to one property  
  - Each booking may be associated with one payment  

### **Payments**
Handles financial transactions.  
- `id`: Unique payment identifier  
- `booking_id`: References the related booking  
- `amount`: Total payment amount  
- `status`: Payment status (e.g., paid, pending)  
- `timestamp`: Date and time of transaction  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Each payment belongs to a single booking  

### **Reviews**
Captures user feedback for properties.  
- `id`: Unique review identifier  
- `property_id`: References the reviewed property  
- `user_id`: Reviewer (guest)  
- `rating`: Numeric score  
- `comment`: Optional written feedback  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Each review is made by one user for one property

## **API Security**

### **Key Measures Implemented**
- **Authentication**: Hashed passwords with token-based sessions  
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (e.g., guest vs. host)  
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse and DoS attacks  
- **Input Validation**: Shields against injection attacks and invalid data  
- **HTTPS/SSL**: Ensures secure communication  
- **CSRF & CORS Protections**: Guards against cross-site request exploits  
- **Secure Payments**: Integrates trusted payment gateways with fraud detection  

### **Why It Matters**
- Protects sensitive user data  
- Secures bookings and listings  
- Safeguards financial transactions  
- Builds trust with users  
- Helps comply with legal privacy standards
