# airbnb-clone-project

Airbnb Clone Backend – Project Overview
This project is a backend implementation of an Airbnb-like booking platform, designed to simulate the development of a scalable, production-grade web application. It focuses on full-stack principles including secure user management, API design, and data-driven architecture.

Project Goals
- User Management: Secure registration, authentication, and profile handling
- Property Listings: CRUD operations for property listings
- Booking System: Reservation and booking detail management
- Payment Processing: Integrate and manage payment transactions
- Review System: Enable user ratings and feedback
- Performance Optimization: Indexing and caching for fast, efficient data access
  
Technology Stack
- Django + Django REST Framework – RESTful API development
- GraphQL – Flexible data querying
- PostgreSQL – Relational database
- Celery + Redis – Asynchronous task queue and caching
- Docker – Environment consistency across dev and deployment
- CI/CD Pipelines – Automated testing and deployment workflows

Team Roles
-Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
-Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
-DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
-QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

Database Design
The backend architecture is built around several key entities essential to replicating Airbnb’s core functionality.
-Users
Represents both guests and hosts.
- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `name`: Full name  
- `email`: Unique email for authentication  
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password  
- `is_host`: Boolean to differentiate guests and hosts
Relationships
- A user can own multiple properties  
- A user can create multiple bookings and reviews  

-Properties
Represents listings available for booking.
- `id`: Unique property identifier  
- `owner_id`: References a user (host)  
- `title`: Short description of the listing  
- `location`: Address or region  
- `price_per_night`: Cost of stay per night
Relationships 
- Each property belongs to one host  
- A property can have many bookings and reviews  

-Bookings
Tracks reservations made by users.
- `id`: Unique booking identifier  
- `property_id`: References the property being booked  
- `user_id`: References the guest making the booking  
- `check_in`: Check-in date  
- `check_out`: Check-out date
Relationships
- Each booking links one user to one property  
- Each booking may be associated with one payment  

-Payments
Handles financial transactions.
- `id`: Unique payment identifier  
- `booking_id`: References the related booking  
- `amount`: Total payment amount  
- `status`: Payment status (e.g., paid, pending)  
- `timestamp`: Date and time of transaction
Relationships
- Each payment belongs to a single booking  

-Reviews
Captures user feedback for properties.
- `id`: Unique review identifier  
- `property_id`: References the reviewed property  
- `user_id`: Reviewer (guest)  
- `rating`: Numeric score  
- `comment`: Optional written feedback
Relationships
- Each review is made by one user for one property

Feature Breakdown
1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

API Security
Key Measures Implemented
- Authentication: Secure login with hashed passwords and token-based sessions  
- Authorization: Role-based access to restrict actions (e.g., hosts vs. guests)  
- Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse and denial-of-service attacks  
- Input Validation: Guards against injection and malicious inputs  
- HTTPS/SSL: Secures data transmission  
- CSRF & CORS Protections: Shields APIs from cross-site exploits  
- Secure Payments: Uses trusted gateways with fraud prevention

Why It Matters
- Protects sensitive user data
- Secures bookings and listings from tampering  
- Safeguards financial transactions  
- Builds trust in the platform  
- Ensures compliance with privacy laws  

CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines are automated workflows that streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying code. They help teams deliver features, fixes, and updates faster and more reliably.
Why CI/CD Matters for This Project:
- Reduces bugs by running automated tests on every code change
- Speeds up deployment, ensuring new features go live quickly and safely
- Improves team collaboration, with standardized workflows
- Ensures consistency across environments using tools like Docker
Common Tools:
- GitHub Actions: Automate tests and deployments directly from GitHub
- Docker: Package your app into containers for consistent builds
- PostgreSQL Service Containers: For integration testing against live databases
- Celery & Redis Containers: To test background task flows in CI
- Heroku, Vercel, or AWS: For deploying and hosting your app
